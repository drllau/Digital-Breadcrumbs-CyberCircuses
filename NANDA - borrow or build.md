# Borrow, Build or Barter?

[NANDA project](https://projnanda.github.io/projnanda/#/) asks what would the agent-centric web look like and how to get there. A [RFC](https://github.com/aidecentralized/nandapapers/blob/main/v0.3%20Upgrade%20or%20Switch%20-%20Do%20We%20Need%20a%20New%20Registry%20Architecture%20for%20the%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents.pdf) postulates that substituting billions of humans for "... trillions of always on software agents ... [need] more robust and scalable infrastructure", starting with address/registration for the discovery phase. The agentic framework can either:
1. bind each software agent to an IPv4/v6 address (walled garden);
2. attach (luggage) tags for audit logs and security attestations (public parkways + private driveways); or
3. navigate polycentric federation of registries with tamper-evident ledgers (nomad with DID footprints).

Building a new agentic architecture unencumbered by technical debt has innate appeal but faces steep switiching costs, not to mention significant upfront capital demands. Whilst ledgers provide new address spaces, synchronising/traversing a federated/sharded service mesh with latencies of <50 ms is challenging. The security principle of least privilege means that access/authorisation needs to be revoked as soon as a consistency check fails, capability proof discarded, or rollback challenge issued.
